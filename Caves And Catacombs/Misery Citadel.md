Welcome to Misery Citadel 
This dungeon is a Citadel. It is located in a swamp, and it is constructed of Natural Formation.
This dungeon is Decayed/Abandoned. Lighting: Torches. It is Two Floors.
The quest goal: Defeat a Special Enemy.
The enemy to be defeated is Lich.
I'm not ready for this, so I'm going to do more exploring to complete another quest.
