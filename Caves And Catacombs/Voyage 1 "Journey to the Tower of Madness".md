Welcome to Tower of Madness 
This dungeon is a Catacombs. It is located in a forest, and it is constructed of Masonry/Carved Stone.
This dungeon is Well Maintained. Lighting: No Lighting. It is Two Floors.
The quest goal: Map the entire Dungeon.

As you venture into the heart of the Whispering Woods, the ancient Tower of Madness rises like a skeletal sentinel, its walls crafted from rough-hewn stone and mortar that seem to writhe with malevolent intent. The air is heavy with the scent of damp earth and decay as you step into the darkness, the only sound the soft crunch of gravel beneath your feet. Your quest: to chart every nook and cranny of this foreboding Catacombs, a task that will require cunning, courage, and a healthy dose of paranoia. With two levels of twisting tunnels and chambers waiting to be explored, the Tower's secrets are yours for the taking - but beware, for the darkness within is said to hold terrors beyond mortal comprehension.Ô∏è
