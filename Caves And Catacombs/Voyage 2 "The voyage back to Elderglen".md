	- Here is what Chat GPT said that that the shaman said:
		- _"Welcome, seeker of truth, to the heart of the whispering bog. The spirits murmur of your arrival and the choices that lie before you. Here in the mire, the past is as alive as the present, and the future is but a wisp on the wind._
		- _You come with purpose, but know this: the swamp reveals only what you are ready to see. The path you tread is tangled, much like the roots beneath our feet. To find clarity, you must first embrace the chaos. Listen to the croak of the frogs and the rustle of the reeds; they speak in riddles that hold the answers you seek._
		- _Beware of the shadows that dance between the trees. They are not all as they seem. Some are but echoes of lost souls, while others are warnings of darker things that hunger for the light of your spirit._
		- _Your journey is a tapestry woven by choices. The threads of fate can be twisted, but not unraveled. The spirits have shown me glimpses of what lies ahead, but the visions are murky. Trust in your heart, for it is a compass more true than any map._
		- _Remember, adventurer, the swamp does not simply test your strength, but your wisdom and resolve. To leave this place with the answers you seek, you must first find them within yourself. Now go, and may the spirits guide your steps._
		- _And should you falter, return to these waters. The swampâ€™s embrace is ever open to those who seek redemption and clarity."_
